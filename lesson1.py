STRATEGY

1. State problem, identify input and output formats
2. Brainstorm example inputs and outputs that cover all edge cases
3. Brainstorm a solution for the problem in plain english
4. Implement solution and text example inputs. Fix bugs
5. Analyze complexity, identify inefficiencies. 
6. Apply technique to overcome inefficiencies - this is where DSA becomes significant. Repeat 3-6

PROBLEM

Lucy has cards with numbers on them - they are arranged in decreasing order and turned around 
(we don't know the specific numbers). She challenges Jose to pick a given number from the cards in as
little moves as possible. Write a function to help Jose.

DSA is crucial because it helps you:
1. To think about problems systematically
2. To envision different inputs, outputs , and edge cases
3. Communicate ideas clearly to colleagues and collaborate
4. Convert thoughts and ideas into code
