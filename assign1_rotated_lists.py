PROBLEM

You are given a list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of 
times. Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list 
was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function should have the worst-case complexity of 
O(logN), where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list 
are unique.

Example: The list [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4] was obtained by rotating the sorted list 
[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] 3 times.

We define "rotating a list" as removing the last element of the list and adding it before the 
first element.

"Sorted list" refers to a list where the elements are arrange in increasing order.

"""
A function that takes a rotated list, then counts the minimum number of times a sorted list 
had to be rotated to result in that given rotated list.

Inputs:
1. rotated_ls - a rotated list (ex. [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4] )

Outputs:
1. rotations - an int as the number of times an original sorted list was rotated to 
match input nums (ex. if our original sorted list is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9], 
our output would be "3")
