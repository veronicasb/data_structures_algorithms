2 common problems in dynamic programming:

# Longest Common Subsequence

"""
PROBLEM

Write a function to find the length of the longest common subsequence between
two sequences.

A sequence is a group of items with deterministic ordering.

A subsequence is a sequence obtained by deleting zero or more elements from 
another sequence.

"""

"""
METHOD

1. State problem clearly and indentify inputs and outputs
2. Brainstorm example inputs and outputs, especially ones that cover edge cases
3. Brainstorm a correct solution for the problem stated in plain English
4. Implement solution and test example inputs. Fix bugs.
5. Analyze complexity and indentify inefficiencies.
6. Improve inefficiencies, then repeat 3-6

"""


# Step 1

"""
A function that identifies the longest common subsequence between 2 sequences, 
then counts and returns the number of characters in that subsequence.

Parameters: 
1. seq1: a sequence (e.g. "serendipitous")
2. seq2: another sequence (e.g. "precipitation")

Return:
1. len_lcs: length of longest common subsequence (e.g. 7)
