"""
Function that efficiently multiplies 2 polynomials and represents the solution as a list.

Input:

1. poly1 = a list of integers representing a polynomial (e.g. [2, 0, 5, 7] represents 
2 + 5x^2 + 7x^3)

2. poly2 = a list of integers representing a polynomial (e.g. [3, 4, 2] represents 
3 + 4x + 2x^2)

Output:
1. answer = a list of integers representing a polynomial (e.g. [6, 8, 19, 41, 38, 14] 
represents 6 + 8x + 19x^2 + 41x^3 + 38x^4 + 14x^5)
